            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
              What began as a family hobby quickly became our livelihood. I loved taking engines apart and putting them right again, and neighbors started asking for help — one job led to another, and today we run a full-time, family-owned auto repair shop. We combine years of hands-on experience with up-to-date techniques to diagnose and repair everything from routine maintenance to complex mechanical issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our approach is simple: do the job properly, explain it in plain language, and stand behind our work. That means honest pricing, timely turnarounds, and a level of care you don’t get from large chains. Whether it’s a scheduled service or an unexpected breakdown, our goal is to get you back on the road safely and confidently.
            </p>
